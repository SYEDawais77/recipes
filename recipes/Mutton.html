<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>

    <li>
        Heat up your oil/ghee in a wok, cast iron skillet or karahi. Add the lamb/mutton and fry on high, stirring
        constantly until all the meat has changed its color.</li>
    <li>
        the minced ginger and garlic and give this a quick fry, until the raw smell goes away. Don't allow the ginger
        and garlic to color too much.</li>
    <li>
        Add all the spices and 1/1.5 cups of water for lamb and 2.5/3 cups of water for mutton. Bring to a boil, then
        turn the heat down to low and put to lid on. Simmer for 1hr for lamb and 2hrs for mutton. Keep checking during
        this time to ensure there is sufficient water and top up a little as and if required Lamb / Mutton Karahi - An
        Easy, Traditional Recipe
        Once the simmer time is up, the meat should be 80% done and there shouldn't be much water in the pan. The pan
        will look quite oily (remember, you can remove the oil at the end if you want!)
    <li>
        Turn the heat to high. Add the tomatoes. Let this cook on high, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of
        the pan. The tomatoes will release A LOT of moisture. Keep stirring and just allow everything to concentrate
    </li>

    <li>
        Once the gravy (masala) looks wet but almost done and the oil is beginning to come to the surface, add in the chopped coriander and green chilli. Turn the heat to low and allow this to simmer without the lid on for 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Garnish with additional chopped coriander and the matchstick-cut ginger.
    </li>
